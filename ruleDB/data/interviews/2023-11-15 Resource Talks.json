He emphasizes contrarian investing, the case for deep speculation in hated silver equities, and his rationale for stock selection and portfolio exit tactics. Rule provides both macro perspectives on silver's risk/reward and detailed company commentary, including operational, jurisdictional, and management-related insights."

      "pos_comments": "Fan of Pan American despite recent disappointment. Has doubled and tripled money in past cycles, praises company’s portfolio overhaul and asset sales after Tahoe takeover. Thinks if the Cascabel (Guatemala) and Navidad (Argentina) projects are put into production, silver output could triple for little increase in G&A, providing significant upside.",
      "neg_comments": "Major dilution to fund Yamana acquisition; initial disappointment led to share sales. Recent price drops make current value more attractive. Catalysts (permit progress at Cascabel, Navidad) are social/political and not guaranteed.",

      "neg_comments": "Biggest risk is turnaround at Jerritt Canyon mine; company has a habit of buying underperforming operations and investing heavily to fix them. Will not upgrade rating until Jerritt Canyon is demonstrably on track.",
