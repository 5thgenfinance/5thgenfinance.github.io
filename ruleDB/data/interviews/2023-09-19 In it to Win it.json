    "general_comments": "Rick Rule discusses why royalty and streaming companies provide the lowest-risk entry to natural resources investing, offers detailed views on the uranium bull market and sector allocation (beta vs. alpha), and shares explicit rankings (1-10) and comments on a broad range of gold, uranium, natural gas and junior miners. He emphasizes that portfolio construction favors owning high-quality, scalable companies and stresses due diligence. Rick covers macro commodity cycles, outlines recent changes in Mexican mining risks, and delivers a 'lightning round' of updated stock ratings, including personal ownership status and rationale for recent upgrades or downgrades."
