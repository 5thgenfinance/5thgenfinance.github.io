He expresses bullish long-term views on gold and copper, notes cyclical opportunity and deep undervaluation in uranium juniors, and highlights his preference for operational excellence and exploration predictability. Rick systematically ranks 40 companies across four sectors by a blend of financial, operational, political risk, and personal ownership criteria."
