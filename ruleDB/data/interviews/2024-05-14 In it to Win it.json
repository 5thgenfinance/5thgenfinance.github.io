    "general_comments": "Rick Rule covers uranium, gold, natural gas, and royalty stocks ahead of the Rule Symposium. He offers candid macro commentary: the easy money in uranium is made but the long-term remains extremely constructive, US policy now subsidizes uranium producers, and American term contracts will create a pricing premium. He gives explicit stock rankings (1–10) and detailed reasoning for major uranium and gold stocks, prospect generators, and royalty companies. Interviews cover the risk/reward equation in the current price environment, the impact of dilution, and how management performance shapes rating upgrades and downgrades."
