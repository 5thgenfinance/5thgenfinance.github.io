    "general_comments": "Rick Rule analyzes 20+ mining, energy, and royalty stocks with explicit rankings (1-10) as of June 14, 2025. He explains why some gold stocks are undervalued on a net present value (NPV) basis at today’s gold prices despite recent rallies, and underscores the need to track management quality, project IRR, and country risk. He highlights threats from poorly timed financings, points out which companies are facing operational setbacks, and discusses catalysts such as strategic M&A, asset sales, and sovereign support for critical minerals. Rick provides both macro and micro rationale, with numerous examples of personal ownership, explicit buy/hold/sell rationale, and portfolio construction insights."
