    "general_comments": "Rick Rule covers his 2025 outlook for gold, silver, uranium, coal, oil & gas stocks, giving explicit 1–10 rankings, rationale, and detailed macro commentary. He stresses that his ratings reflect a unique mix of short-term valuation, long-term operating leverage, management quality, and asset class scarcity. Rick points out that sector-wide, the easy money in uranium and silver has been made, but some opportunities remain for those with patience. Most companies ranked cluster in the 4–6 range. He highlights persistent underinvestment, macro drivers for higher metals prices, and gives advanced explanation on portfolio construction (e.g. risk/reward, jurisdiction, and business model)."
