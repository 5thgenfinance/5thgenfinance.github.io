    "general_comments": "Rick Rule provides in-depth rankings and commentary on over 50 gold, silver, and uranium companies as of June 30, 2025. He emphasizes that his rankings reflect a combination of net present value to enterprise value, management quality, operating performance, and market-driven value changes. Rick stresses that most stocks he follows cluster in the 4–6 range, with relatively few ranked as 3, due to market fluctuations and improved company performance. He highlights macro factors including persistent undervaluation of precious metals equities, shifts in risk tolerance, and the unique opportunity set in uranium given changes in long-term contracting trends and global supply-demand.”
