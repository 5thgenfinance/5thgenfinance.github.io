    "general_comments": "Rick Rule explains why gold’s breakout above $3,000 is only the start of a bigger secular uptrend, citing prolonged US dollar debasement and echoes of the 1970s. He discusses macro cycles for gold, uranium, and natural gas, advises sector contrarians to rotate capital into select junior uranium stocks, and shares portfolio principles. Rule also addresses management quality, capital allocation, and political risk (especially in Mexico, Canada, Africa, and Latin America). He ranks over a dozen mining and royalty companies, answers viewer questions about operational setbacks, and details his strict discipline for stock ratings and portfolio construction as of late March 2025."
