    "general_comments": "Rick Rule discusses royalty companies as the best risk-adjusted way to play commodities, especially gold and uranium. He notes the deep undervaluation of uranium juniors, sees value in high-quality gold/silver royalty leaders, and stresses business model durability. Rick explains that most investors misunderstand both uranium term contracts and the capital efficiency of the royalty model. He ranks major royalty companies, is forthright about his ownership interests, and describes strong optionality for leading firms due to future large streaming deals. He also highlights specific concerns and optimism for coal, oil, and water-handling royalties, forecasting a wave of M&A and sector rerating."
