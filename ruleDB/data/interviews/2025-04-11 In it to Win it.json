    "general_comments": "Rick Rule shares lessons from market volatility, why most investors act irrationally during sell-offs, and how separating price from value aids disciplined investing. He argues gold remains the prime beneficiary of increased liquidity and government intervention, notes uranium sentiment has collapsed among recent entrants, and sees crisis as opportunity. He addresses management quality, sector cycles, and individual company rankings, especially among miners and royalty firms. Rule discusses why he is buying in panic markets, new ventures like Battle Bank, and forecasts a structural shortfall in oil and gas due to underinvestment."
