    "general_comments": "Rick Rule delivers updated opinions and ownership disclosures on 40 stocks—10 uranium, 10 gold, 10 silver, and 10 copper companies—in this April 2024 session. He provides macro commentary on hated commodities (platinum, lithium, nickel), lays out a thesis for structural copper shortfall, and explains why the sure money in uranium is in term contracts rather than price upside. He stresses management quality, project size, country risk, and the superiority of large-scale deposits. Rule describes why investors must distinguish between speculative leverage and true value creation and highlights a bias toward large-cap, highly predictive resource investments."
