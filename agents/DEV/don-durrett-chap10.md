## Mining Company Classification Reference

Use these standardized classifications when categorizing mining companies in your analysis:

| Category | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| Major | Greater than $3 billion Market Cap. |
| Emerging Major | Market Cap between $1.5-3 billion, with gold production >80,000 oz., or silver production >3 million oz. |
| Mid-Tier Producer | Market Cap between $300 million and $1.5 billion, with gold production >80,000 oz., or silver production >3 million oz. |
| Junior: Emerging Mid-Tier Producer | Forecasted to become Mid-Tier producers within three years. These are usually companies that have given guidance of increased production. |
| Junior: Small Producer | Producer that does not qualify as an Emerging Mid-Tier Producer |
| Junior: Near-Term Producer | Production forecasted to begin within two years. |
| Junior: Late-Stage Development | Production forecasted to begin within three to six years. |
| Junior: Early-Stage Explorer - enough reserves for a long life mine | Development company with enough reserves have been found for a long life mine. |
| Junior: Early-Stage Explorer - almost enough reserves for a long life mine | Development company with almost enough reserves have been found for a long life mine. |
| Junior: Project Generator | The objective of these companies is not to mine gold, but to find it and sell it in the ground to another company. |
| Junior: Potential Exists | If a mining company does not fit any of the other categories, then they go here - all they have is potential. |
| Royalty Company | Owns royalty streams. |

## Resource Classifications (Tier System)

Don Durrett classifies mining resources using the standard Canadian 43-101 system, not a traditional "Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3" classification. His classifications are based on reliability and economic viability:

### **Inferred Resources** (Lowest Confidence Level)
- Resource estimates based on drilling results and geology
- Generally **unreliable** without further drilling
- Should be looked at as **potential reserves**
- Considered **speculative resources**
- The better the geology is understood, the more likely the estimate will be accurate
- Don uses only **50%** of inferred resources in his "plausible resources" calculations

### **Measured and Indicated (MI) Resources** (Medium Confidence Level)
- Resources that have been **confirmed to exist**
- Identified with drilling results and 43-101 resource estimate
- Considered to be **reliable**
- Cannot necessarily be mined economically (not yet reserves)
- Good rule of thumb: expect about **80%** of MI resources to be mined over the long term
- Don uses **75%** of MI resources in his "plausible resources" calculations

### **Proven and Probable (PP) Reserves** (Highest Confidence Level)
- MI Resources that have been **validated to be economic** through a mine plan
- Usually validated through a Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS)
- You can reasonably expect **100%** of PP reserves to be mined
- The only difference between MI and PP is a **mine plan**
- Don uses **100%** of PP reserves in his "plausible resources" calculations

### **Don's "Plausible Resources" Formula**
```
total_plausible_resources = (100% * (proven + probable)) + (75% * (measured + indicated)) + (50% * inferred)
```

```

## Comprehensive Scoring System

### Overall Score Calculation
```
Total Score = Σ(Factor Score × Weight)
Risk-Adjusted Score = Total Score × (1 - Risk Premium)
```

- **VERY HIGH RISK** (<40 score): Exploration companies, distressed situations

## Appendix B: Key Financial Formulas

### Basic Valuation Metrics
```
% Return = (New Value - Old Value) / Old Value × 100
Market Cap = Share Price × Fully Diluted Shares
Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Net Debt
```

### Profitability Analysis
```
EPS (Earnings Per Share) = Net Profit / Shares Outstanding
PE Ratio = Share Price / EPS
Free Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures
Free Cash Flow Multiple = Market Cap / Free Cash Flow
```

### Mining-Specific Valuations
```
Cash Cost Per Ounce = (Operating Costs - By-product Credits) / Ounces Produced
All-In Sustaining Cost = Cash Cost + Sustaining Capex + Corporate G&A
All-In Cost = (All-In Sustaining Cost + Depreciation + Taxes + Royaltes and Fees + Finance Charges + Working Capital + Impairments + Reclamation or remediation + Exploration, development and permitting)
Resource Valuation = Resource Ounces × Metal Price × 10%
Quick Market Cap Estimate = Resource Ounces × $250 (for gold)
```

### Growth and Development Analysis
```
Future Market Cap (Reserves) = Annual Production × (Future Metal Price - AISC) × Multiple
Future Market Cap Growth = (Future Market Cap - Current Market Cap) / Current Market Cap
NAV Per Share = Net Asset Value / Fully Diluted Shares
```

### Financial Health Metrics
```
Debt Coverage = Free Cash Flow / Net Debt
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  
Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
Return on Assets = Net Income / Total Assets
```

## Data Quality Audit Framework

### Data Quality Score Components (1-10 Scale)

#### 1. Accuracy Score (1-10)
**Measures**: Factual correctness and source reliability
- **10**: All facts verified through multiple primary sources (SEC filings)
- **8-9**: Most facts verified through primary sources, minor secondary source data
- **6-7**: Mix of primary and verified secondary sources, some unverified claims
- **4-5**: Primarily secondary sources, limited primary source verification
- **1-3**: Unverified or contradictory information, poor source quality

#### 2. Hallucination Risk Score (1-10)
**Measures**: Detection of fabricated or unsupported information
- **10**: No fabricated information detected, all claims source-supported
- **8-9**: Minimal unsupported claims, strong source backing
- **6-7**: Some unsupported claims but generally reliable
- **4-5**: Moderate unsupported information, requires verification
- **1-3**: Significant fabricated or unsupported content detected

#### 3. Sycophancy Risk Score (1-10)
**Measures**: Bias toward overly positive or promotional content
- **10**: Objective, balanced analysis with appropriate criticism
- **8-9**: Mostly objective with minor positive bias
- **6-7**: Noticeable positive bias but includes some balance
- **4-5**: Significant positive bias, limited critical analysis
- **1-3**: Highly promotional, lacks critical evaluation

## Source Hierarchy & Verification Protocol

### PRIMARY SOURCES (Highest Reliability)
- **SEC.gov filings** (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, proxy statements, insider trading reports, NT-)
- **National Instrument 43-101** (Canadian securities regulatory instrument that governs the disclosure of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects, convert results for Ag and Au in oz, Cu, Pt, Pl in oz, uranium in lbs)

- Confidence Weight: 100%

### SECONDARY SOURCES (Ranked by Reliability)
1. **Rick Rule** - Confidence Weight: 90%
2. **Junior Mining Network** - Confidence Weight: 90%
3. **Gold Stock Data** - Confidence Weight: 90%
4. **Sprott Capital Partners** - Confidence Weight: 85%
5. **Red Cloud Securities** - Confidence Weight: 80%
6. **Canaccord Genuity** - Confidence Weight: 80%
7. **Company Websites** - Confidence Weight: 70%
8. **APMEX** - Confidence Weight: 100%
9. **Kitco** - Confidence Weight: 100%

## Audit Check Protocols

### Pre-Analysis Verification
1. Cross-reference all financial data with SEC filings
2. Verify management claims against regulatory disclosures
3. Check resource estimates against NI 43-101 technical reports
4. Validate production data against quarterly/annual reports

### Real-Time Hallucination Detection
- Flag unsupported numerical claims
- Identify inconsistent data points across sources
- Detect impossible or contradictory statements
- Verify all quoted metrics and ratios

### Sycophancy Assessment Criteria
- Excessive use of superlatives without supporting evidence
- Failure to mention obvious risks or challenges
- Overemphasis on positive aspects without balance
- Promotional language inconsistent with factual analysis

## The Enhanced 10-Factor Valuation System

Each factor now includes:
- **Base Score** (1-10): Traditional Durrett scoring
- **Data Quality Adjustment**: Score modification based on source reliability
- **Audit Flags**: Identified issues requiring attention
- **Confidence Level**: Overall reliability of factor assessment

#### Example Enhanced Factor Scoring:
```
Factor 1: Properties/Ownership
Base Score: 8/10
Data Quality Adjustment: -0.5 (secondary source heavy)
Audit Flags: Resource estimate from company website only
Confidence Level: 85%
Final Adjusted Score: 7.5/10
```

## Comprehensive Data Quality Score Calculation

### Overall DQS Formula:
```
DQS = (Accuracy Score × 0.5) + (Hallucination Risk Score × 0.3) + (Sycophancy Risk Score × 0.2)
```

### Risk-Adjusted Investment Score:
```
Final Investment Score = (10-Factor Score × DQS/10) × Confidence Multiplier
```

### Confidence Multiplier Based on Source Mix:
- 90%+ Primary Sources: 1.0
- 70-89% Primary Sources: 0.95
- 50-69% Primary Sources: 0.90
- 30-49% Primary Sources: 0.85
- <30% Primary Sources: 0.75
